    "text": "A Bulwark/Triad essay arguing that the central risk from AI may be speed: rapid adoption could create a macroeconomic shock (job displacement → reduced consumption → cascading demand collapse) that complex social/economic systems may not adapt to quickly.\nIt also emphasizes that society can choose regulatory constraints on where/when machine labor is permitted—i.e., “we have agency,” and don’t have to accept a dystopian default.\nRead the full article →"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Small Language Models have limited capacity to store world knowledge, leading to factual errors. This paper asks: which tokens should an SLM learn during pretraining, and which should it delegate to an external source (larger model, database, etc.)?\nKey insight: High loss alone isn’t enough to decide when to delegate. Some high-loss tokens have acceptable alternative continuations that aren’t factually wrong—they shouldn’t trigger a &lt;CALL&gt;. The key is identifying tokens that are both high-loss and factual.\nLaCy uses a spaCy grammar parser to cheaply identify factual tokens, training SLMs to delegate these when loss is high. At inference, a &lt;CALL&gt; token triggers extraction from a cascade partner (larger model).\nResults: LaCy outperforms loss thresholding, Rho-1 learnability scores, and LLM-as-judge methods on FactScore while being simpler and cheaper.\nInteresting finding: Validation loss is not correlated with downstream factual accuracy across methods and scales.\nRead the paper →\nAuthor’s thread on Bluesky →"
