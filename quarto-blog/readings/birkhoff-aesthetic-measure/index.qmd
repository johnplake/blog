A pioneering attempt by the Harvard mathematician George David Birkhoff to create a mathematical theory of aesthetic value. Birkhoff proposed a simple formula: **M = O/C**, where aesthetic measure (M) equals order (O) divided by complexity (C). The more order achieved with less complexity, the higher the aesthetic value.

Though predating Shannon's information theory by over a decade, Birkhoff's work anticipates information-theoretic aesthetics by framing beauty as a relationship between pattern and variety. The book applies this framework to polygons, ornaments, vases, music, and poetry—an ambitious attempt to unify aesthetic judgment across domains through mathematical formalization.

While the specific formula has been criticized and refined, the book remains influential as an early example of computational/formal approaches to aesthetics.
