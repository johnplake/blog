A Thinking Machines post on constraining neural network **weight matrices** to live on manifolds (e.g., Stiefel manifold) and designing **manifold-aware optimizers**. Frames normalization/constraints as a way to keep tensors “healthy” and proposes the idea of **modular manifolds** for composing constraints in larger systems.
