Stories are not just chains of events—they are built from changing relationships between characters. This paper introduces the concept of **relational arcs**: the trajectories of interpersonal ties (friendships, rivalries, romances, kinship) as they rise and fall across novels' timelines.

Using the Artificial Relationships in Fiction (ARF) dataset with over 120,000 annotated relationships from 96 novels (1850–1950), the authors identify recurring patterns in how ties evolve. Key findings:
- Genres and historical periods favor different relational patterns
- Relationships function as measurable structures of plot
- Four principal arc shapes emerge: Rise, U-shape, Decline, and Oscillating
- Alliance and kinship scaffold exposition; conflict peaks near climax; romance concentrates at closure

The work bridges classical narratology (Aristotle, Propp, Greimas) with computational methods, showing that relationship transformations are not merely thematic features but dynamic scaffolding for narrative structure.
