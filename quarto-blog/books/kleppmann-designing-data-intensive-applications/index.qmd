The definitive guide to the principles and practicalities of data systems. Kleppmann examines the big ideas behind reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems—covering everything from data models and query languages to replication, partitioning, transactions, and stream processing.

Often called "DDIA" in engineering circles, this book bridges theory and practice exceptionally well. It explains not just *how* systems work, but *why* they're designed that way—including the tradeoffs and failure modes. Essential reading for anyone building or operating data-intensive applications.
