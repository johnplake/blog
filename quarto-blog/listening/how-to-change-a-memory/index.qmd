Neuroscientist Steve Ramirez discusses his groundbreaking research on memory manipulation and his book "How to Change a Memory: One Neuroscientist's Quest to Alter the Past."

**Key topics:**
- Artificially activating memories in mice using optogenetics (lasers + genetically engineered neurons)
- Successfully reversing depression symptoms by activating positive memories
- How memories are malleable ("like lava that melts and hardens into new shapes")
- Restoring memories thought lost to Alzheimer's, traumatic brain injury, sleep deprivation
- Ethical implications of memory manipulation (MK Ultra comparison)
- His late lab partner Xu Liu and how grief shaped his understanding of memory
- Personal struggles with addiction after Xu's death

**Quote:** "Memory is the thing that threads and unifies our overall sense of being and our sense of identity."
